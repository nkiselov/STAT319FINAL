# Introduction

This dataset covers the experimental study of corn yield and nitrogen fertilizer treatment with field characteristics from the Las Rosas farm in Rio Cuarto, Cordoba, Argentina. In it, data was collected using yield monitor from strip trials during the harvests in years 1999 and 2001 to determine the potential of spatial econometric analysis in estimating the site-specific crop response functions when it comes to applying nitrogen treatment. There are 3443 operations and 8 variables, including the year, latitude, longitude, yield in quintals/ha, amount of nitrogen in kg/ha, topographic factor, brightness value, rep factor, and nitrogen as a factor. Of these variables, both the topographic, rep, and nitrogen factors, are qualitative while the rest are quantitative.

# Data Statistics

```{r}
#| label: tbl-kable-example
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of Yield by Nitrogen Fertilizer Level"

sample_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:100,
  x = rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  y = 3 + 0.4 * x + rnorm(100, sd = 5)
)

dat %>% group_by(nf) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR = IQR(yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    Range = paste(min(yield, na.rm = TRUE), "-", max(yield, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% kable(
      digits = 2,
      col.names = c("Level", "Mean", "Median", "SD", "IQR", "Range"))
```

## Advanced Tables with kableExtra

For even more formatting options, use the `{kableExtra}` package:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-advanced
#| tbl-cap: "Advanced table formatting with kableExtra"
#| html-table-processing: none

sample_data %>%
  group_by(cut(x, breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))) %>%
  summarize(
    Count = n(),
    Mean_Y = mean(y),
    SD_Y = sd(y),
    Min_Y = min(y),
    Max_Y = max(y),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    col.names = c("X Category", "Count", "Mean Y", "SD Y", "Min Y", "Max Y"),
    align = "lccccc"
  ) %>%
  kable_classic() %>%
  add_footnote(
    label = c("Data grouped by tertiles of x values."),
    notation = "none",
    threeparttable = TRUE
  )
```

Notice how @tbl-advanced includes footnotes and styling. The `html-table-processing: none` option prevents Quarto from re-processing tables created with `{kableExtra}`.

# Creating Figures with R

Figures generated from R code should include proper labels, captions, and alt text for accessibility.

## Basic Plot with Caption

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between predictor x and response y"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot showing a positive linear relationship between x and y variables with points distributed around a linear trend"

ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Predictor (x)",
    y = "Response (y)"
  )
```

As shown in @fig-scatter, there appears to be a positive linear association between the predictor and the response.

## Plot with Alt Text from Code

You can also specify alt text within the `labs()` function and extract it automatically:

```{r}
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of predictor variable x"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-alt: !expr ggplot2::get_alt_text(ggplot2::last_plot())

ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 2,
    fill = "steelblue",
    color = "black",
    alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Predictor (x)",
    y = "Frequency",
    alt = "Histogram showing the distribution of x values, which appears approximately normal and centered around 50"
  )
```

The distribution in @fig-histogram shows that x values are approximately normally distributed.

## Multiple Plots

```{r}
#| label: fig-multiplot
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of distributions"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-alt: "Two boxplots side by side comparing the distributions of x and y variables"

# Reshape data for plotting
plot_data <- sample_data %>%
  select(x, y) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    x = "Variable",
    y = "Value",
    fill = "Variable"
  )
```

# Including External Images

To include external images (not generated by R), you can use markdown syntax:

``` markdown
![Caption for your image](path/to/image.png){#fig-external}
```

Or use knitr:

``` r
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image.png")
```

# Cross-Referencing

Cross-referencing allows you to refer to tables, figures, and sections by name rather than hard-coding numbers.

## Referencing Tables

To reference a table, use `@tbl-label`. For example:

-   See @tbl-kable-example for summary statistics
-   Compare results in @tbl-advanced

## Referencing Figures

To reference a figure, use `@fig-label`. For example:

-   The scatterplot in @fig-scatter shows a clear trend
-   Distribution details are in @fig-histogram

## Referencing Sections

You can also reference sections by adding labels to headings. For example, the heading:

``` markdown
# Data Analysis {#sec-analysis}
```

Can be referenced as: See @sec-analysis for details.

# Key Points to Remember

1.  **Table Labels**: Must start with `tbl-` (e.g., `#| label: tbl-results`)
2.  **Figure Labels**: Must start with `fig-` (e.g., `#| label: fig-plot1`)
3.  **Section Labels**: Use `{#sec-name}` after heading text
4.  **Alt Text**: Always include `fig-alt` for accessibility
5.  **Captions**: Use `fig-cap` for figures and `tbl-cap` for tables
6.  **Code Appendix**: Automatically collects all your code at the end

# Formatting Tips

-   Use **bold** text with `**text**` or `__text__`
-   Use *italic* text with `*text*` or `_text_`
-   Create lists with `-` or numbered lists with `1.`, `2.`, etc.
-   Add inline math with `$equation$` (e.g., $\mu = 50$, $\sigma^2 = 100$)
-   Add display math with `$$equation$$`

# Conclusion

This template provides a foundation for creating professional statistical reports using Quarto. Key features include:

-   Professional tables using both markdown and `kable()`
-   Figures with proper captions and alt text for accessibility
-   Cross-referencing capabilities for tables, figures, and sections
-   Automatic code appendix generation

When you start your own project, replace this content with your analysis while maintaining the structure demonstrated here.

# Code Appendix

The code below shows all the R code used to generate the tables and figures in this document. The code is displayed here for transparency and reproducibility but is hidden in the main body of the report.

```{r}

#| echo: true
#| eval: false
